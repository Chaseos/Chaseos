<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Chase!</h1>
<h3 align="center">📱 Kotlin developer building Android apps and libraries with a user-first mindset.</h3>

- 🔭 I’m currently open for work!

- 🌱 I’m currently building apps for Compose Multiplatform, WearOS, and Chrome Extensions! (🧘 Meditation app coming soon!)

- ⏩ <b>Simple Video Speed Controller</b> - I made a Chrome Extension written by AI!

- 🌍 I believe in giving back to the community and often volunteer my coding, team lead, and team management skills at a non-profit, [Animal Help Now](https://ahnow.org/) and [Pet Help and Rescue](https://www.phar.org/). Check out our apps [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6630436480644093730) [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/animal-watch/id511153460)

- 🤝 We are always looking for volunteers. [Here](https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/org768702.jsp) are our active positions.

- 🤖 I have worked on various projects including Robert Half, Southwest Airlines, Animal Supply Co, Frontier Communications, Allegiant Airlines, and the Apptentive / Alchemer mobile SDKs.

- 📖 I ♥️ continuous learning. I block out time every week to learn about new things relevant to my profession.

- 💬 I enjoy writing documentation, knowing it will help reduce the bus factor and help various members of our team.

- 🔍 I strive for quality in my work, without making perfect the enemy of good.

- 🗣️ I'm a team advocate, speaking out when I feel something is off or could be better.

- 🤹 I prioritize having a life/work balance. Work to live, not live to work. (!4️⃣ day work week advocate 🗓️!)
