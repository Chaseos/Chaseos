<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Chase!</h1>
<h3 align="center">📱 Kotlin developer building Android apps and libraries with a user-first mindset.</h3>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Apptentive Kit Android](https://github.com/apptentive/apptentive-kit-android)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **how to effectively use natural language processing tools** (AI tools are no longer the future. It's now).

- 🚀 My work GitHub is [ChaseApptentive](https://github.com/ChaseApptentive)

- 👨‍💻 All of my current projects are available at [https://github.com/apptentive](https://github.com/apptentive)

- 📝 I regularly write Apptentive focused articles on [learn.apptentive.com](learn.apptentive.com)

- 🌍 I believe in giving back to the community and often volunteer my coding and team management skills at a non-profit, [Animal Help Now](https://github.com/AnimalHelpNow).

- 🤝 We are always looking for volunteers. [Here](https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/org768702.jsp) are a few active positions.

- 📖 I ♥️ continuous learning. I block out time every sprint to learn about new things relevant to my work.

- 💬 I enjoy writing documentation, knowing it will help reduce the bus factor and help various members of our team.

- 🔍 I strive for quality in my work, without making perfect the enemy of good.

- 🗣️ I'm a team advocate, speaking out when I feel something is off or could be better.

- 🤹 I prioritize having a life/work balance. Work to live, not live to work.
